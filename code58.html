            <h1>Open MIC</h1><hr>
            The P.E.S College of Engineering in Mandya hosted the engaging OPEN MIC 4.0 on
            June 19, 2023, at the CRC Amphitheatre. Organized by VV, the event provided a
            platform for 35 talented students to showcase their musical abilities across
            diverse genres, including solo film, classical, instrumental, and Bhavageethe
            performances, alongside 10 impressive group film song renditions. With esteemed
            judges like D M Srinivas, S.K Uma, and Archana G, and support from Dr. Nayaka S.R
            and Dr. M N Veena, the event commenced at 4:15 pm, concluding at 7:20 pm,
            followed by an efficient clean-up by 7:45 pm. This successful program not only
            celebrated musical talent but also provided valuable learning experiences in

        <p><h1>The Forgotten Library</h1><hr>
        The library stood at the edge of the ancient forest, its stone walls weathered by time and its windows obscured by
        creeping ivy. Within its dimly lit halls, shelves sagged under the weight of forgotten tomes, their spines cracked and
        pages yellowed with age. It was a place where the whispers of history echoed through the shadows, a sanctuary for
        knowledge lost to the passage of time.
        
        Evelyn Rivers had always been drawn to the library, ever since she was a child. Growing up in the nearby village of
        Eldoria, she would spend hours exploring its labyrinthine corridors, losing herself in the tales of distant lands and
        forgotten legends. Now, as a young woman on the cusp of adulthood, she found herself drawn back to its hallowed halls
        once more.
        
        <div class="hg">
            <img src="mysterious.avif"width="250">
            Pushing open the heavy oak door, Evelyn stepped into the library, her footsteps echoing against the stone floor. Dust
        motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that streamed through the windows, casting a warm glow over the rows of books
        that lined the shelves. She took a deep breath, inhaling the familiar scent of parchment and ink that hung in the air.
        
        As Evelyn wandered deeper into the library, her fingers trailed along the spines of the books, each one a doorway to
        another world waiting to be discovered. She paused before a shelf marked "Ancient Tomes," her gaze lingering on a
        particularly weathered volume nestled among its companions. With a sense of anticipation fluttering in her chest, she
        reached out and plucked the book from its resting place.
        
        The cover was adorned with intricate runes, their meaning lost to all but the most learned scholars. Running her fingers
        over the embossed symbols, Evelyn felt a thrill of excitement course through her veins. This was no ordinary book; it
        was a relic of a bygone era, a window into the mysteries of the past.
        
        With trembling hands, Evelyn opened the book and began to read, her eyes devouring the words that danced across the
        pages. As she delved deeper into its pages, she felt a sense of connection to something greater than herself, as if she
        were touching the very fabric of history itself.
        
        Hours passed in a blur as Evelyn lost herself in the pages of the ancient tome, her mind alight with wonder and
        curiosity. But as the sun dipped below the horizon and the shadows lengthened in the library, she knew that it was time
        to return to the world outside.
        
        Closing the book with a sense of reluctance, Evelyn tucked it under her arm and made her way back to the entrance of the
        library. As she stepped out into the cool evening air, she felt a newfound sense of purpose stirring within her.
        
        Little did she know that her journey was only just beginning, and that the secrets she had uncovered within the pages of
        the ancient tome would set her on a path that would change the course of history forever.</div>
